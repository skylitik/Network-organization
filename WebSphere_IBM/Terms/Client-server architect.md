Is a distributed app structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server-host runs one or more server programs which share their resources with clients.
A client doesn't share any of its resources, but requests a server's content of service function. Client therefore initiate communication sessions with servers which await incoming requests.
